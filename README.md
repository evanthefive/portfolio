What’s happenin cool cat? I’m a Graphic Designer born in ’96 with too many hobbies and passions. Always considered myself a visual learner and I love what I’m doing. As of 2014, I’m currently having a blast going through the Graphic Design Program at Algonquin College. Some may say I’m looking for work, looking to learn and learning to look. On a serious note if you’re looking for creative or production work, I’m your guy!
